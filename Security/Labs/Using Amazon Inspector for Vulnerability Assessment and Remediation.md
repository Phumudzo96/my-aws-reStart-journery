# **Compute Lab: Using Amazon Inspector for Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation**

### **Objective**

Learn how to activate Amazon Inspector, interpret vulnerability reports, and remediate findings for AWS Lambda functions.

---

### **Steps Taken**

* Logged into AWS Console via lab environment.
* Searched for and opened **Amazon Inspector** service.
* Activated Inspector to scan AWS Lambda, EC2, and Amazon ECR resources.
* Waited until Lambda function environment coverage reached 100%.
* Viewed **All Findings** in Amazon Inspector.
* Investigated a Medium severity finding: `CVE-2023-32681` affecting the `requests` package in a Lambda function.
* Opened external link to **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)** for more details.
* Edited the Lambda function’s `requirements.txt` to remove version pinning (`requests==2.20.0` → `requests`) so latest version would be installed.
* Deployed the updated Lambda function.
* Returned to Amazon Inspector and confirmed the finding was marked **Closed** after rescanning.

---

### **Challenges**

* Waiting for Inspector’s scanning process to complete after remediation.
* Needed to ensure the updated package version was deployed before the next scan.
